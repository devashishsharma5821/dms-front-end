<h1 align="center"> ZEBRA CODE REPOSITORY RULES </h1>


**Requirements**: This repository is an approved Zebra Enterprise Managed Code Repository. All Zebra code must be stored within such a repository and in no other locations. Do not store any code in this repository other than Zebra code or code to which Zebra is licensed for use in Zebra products. 

**Restrictions**: Zebra’s source code is proprietary, confidential information. Do not share or disclose Zebra’s source code outside the company without (1) written authorization from Zebra executive leadership (typically Vice President or above), (2) contacting the Legal Department to obtain the appropriate legal protections, including but not limited to a source code license signed by the recipient, and (3) a compelling business reason. Occasions of sharing or disclosing Zebra’s source code should be rare. 

**Copyright Notices**: In a header of each file that includes Zebra authored code, include the following copyright notice in a single line: 

> Copyright [the year the code was created] Zebra Technologies Corporation and/or its affiliates.

Use the word “Copyright” instead of the symbol. Updating the year in the copyright notice is not required. Optionally, the year corresponding to significant modifications may be added to the original year to create a range. For example, if a file created in 2019 is modified in 2022, the copyright notice may be changed to:

> Copyright 2019-2022 Zebra Technologies Corporation and/or its affiliates.
